1️⃣ Why Risk Analysis is Important
Risk analysis helps identify potential system failures before deployment. In real-world classroom environments, uncontrolled conditions such as lighting, movement, and seating arrangements can negatively affect system accuracy and reliability. Early risk identification allows developers to design more robust solutions.

2️⃣ Accuracy-Related Risks
a) Face Occlusion
Faces may be partially blocked due to students sitting close together, turning their heads, or objects covering parts of the face. This can lead to missed detections or incorrect recognition.

b) Lighting Variation
Uneven lighting conditions, shadows, or low illumination reduce facial feature clarity, which decreases recognition accuracy.

c) Camera Angle and Distance
Faces captured from different angles or distances make it difficult for the model to extract consistent facial features, impacting recognition performance.

3️⃣ Performance-Related Risks
Processing multiple faces in a single image increases computational load. This can result in slower response times and delays, especially in real-time attendance systems.

4️⃣ Database and Scalability Risks
As the number of enrolled students increases, the time required to compare facial embeddings also increases. This can cause performance bottlenecks if the system is not optimized for scalability.

5️⃣ Risk Mitigation Strategies
| Risk Area     | Impact       | Mitigation Strategy                         |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Occlusion     | Missed faces | Capture multiple images, use better cameras |
| Lighting      | Low accuracy | Apply image normalization techniques        |
| Similar faces | Wrong match  | Use higher similarity thresholds            |
| Performance   | System delay | Batch processing or GPU acceleration        |

6️⃣ Key Observations
Most system risks arise from environmental and operational factors rather than limitations of the face recognition model itself.

7️⃣ Conclusion of Day 4
Identifying risks at an early stage enables the development of a more reliable, accurate, and scalable face recognition–based attendance system.
