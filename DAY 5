1️⃣ Purpose of the Final Recommendation
The purpose of this phase is to finalize the most suitable technical approach based on prior research and analysis, and to clearly justify all design decisions before beginning full-scale development.

2️⃣ Final Recommended Technical Approach
🔹 Face Detection
Model: RetinaFace
RetinaFace is selected due to its high accuracy in detecting multiple faces in crowded classroom environments, including partially occluded and non-frontal faces.

🔹 Face Recognition
Model: ArcFace
ArcFace generates highly discriminative facial embeddings, making it effective for identifying students even when facial features are very similar.

3️⃣ Database Selection & Justification
✅ Selected Database: SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
🔹 Why SQL is Chosen
SQL databases are structured, reliable, and well-suited for systems with clearly defined relationships such as students, classes, and attendance records. They ensure strong data integrity and consistency.

🔹 Data Stored in SQL Database
| Data Type          | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Student Details    | ID, Name, Roll Number, Class           |
| Face Embeddings    | Numerical vectors linked to student ID |
| Attendance Records | Date-wise attendance data              |
| Class Metadata     | Subject, teacher, time                 |

🔹 Why MongoDB is Not Used
MongoDB is optimized for unstructured or semi-structured data. However, an attendance system requires strong relational consistency, transactional integrity, and structured querying, which SQL databases handle more effectively.

4️⃣ Backend & API Layer
Technology: Flask (REST API)
Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-maintain framework, making it suitable for building RESTful APIs that connect AI models with the database and frontend.

5️⃣ Frontend Recommendation
Approach: Web-Based Application
A web-based interface allows teachers to upload classroom images easily from any device without requiring application installation, improving accessibility and usability.

6️⃣ High-Level System Workflow (No Code)
Student details and face images are registered
Face embeddings are generated and stored in the SQL database
Teacher uploads a classroom image
Faces are detected and recognized
Attendance is marked automatically
Attendance records are stored and displayed

7️⃣ Trade-offs & Design Decisions
| Aspect            | Decision                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Accuracy vs Speed | Accuracy prioritized         |
| SQL vs NoSQL      | Data consistency prioritized |
| Web vs Mobile App | Accessibility prioritized    |

8️⃣ Final Conclusion of Research Phase
The combination of RetinaFace for face detection, ArcFace for face recognition, Flask for backend services, and an SQL database provides a scalable, accurate, and real-world feasible solution for automated classroom attendance systems.
