1️⃣ What is Face Recognition?

Face recognition is the process of identifying a person by comparing their facial features with stored facial data.
Unlike face detection, which only answers “Is there a face?”, face recognition answers “Who is this person?”
In a student attendance system, face recognition is used to identify which student appears in front of the camera.

2️⃣ Face Recognition Workflow
The face recognition process follows these steps:
The detected face is cropped from the image
Facial features are converted into numerical vectors called embeddings
These embeddings are compared with stored embeddings in the database
The closest match determines the person’s identity
This workflow ensures accurate student identification.

3️⃣ Face Embeddings Explained
Face embeddings are numerical representations of a person’s facial features.
Each face is converted into a vector of numbers.
Faces of the same person have embeddings that are very close
Faces of different people have embeddings that are far apart
Embeddings make face comparison fast, efficient, and scalable.

4️⃣ Face Recognition Models Studied
🔹 a) FaceNet
FaceNet generates face embeddings and compares them using distance-based metrics.
Pros: Good accuracy
Cons: Sensitive to lighting changes and real-world variations
It performs well in controlled environments but may struggle in classrooms with uneven lighting.

🔹 b) ArcFace
ArcFace improves face recognition by introducing an angular margin, which creates better separation between identities.
Pros: Very high accuracy, strong discrimination between faces
Cons: Computationally heavy
ArcFace performs exceptionally well in real-world classroom environments.

🔹 c) Dlib (ResNet-based)
Dlib provides a lightweight face recognition model suitable for small-scale systems.
Pros: Simple and fast
Cons: Less robust for large classrooms and similar-looking students
It is not ideal for high-accuracy attendance systems.

5️⃣ Face Matching Techniques
Common techniques used to match face embeddings include:
Euclidean Distance
Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity works better for normalized embeddings, especially those generated by models like ArcFace.

6️⃣ Comparative Summary
Model	Accuracy	Robustness	Classroom Suitability
FaceNet	High	Medium	⚠️ Limited
ArcFace	Very High	High	✅ Best Choice
Dlib	Medium	Low	❌ Not Suitable

7️⃣ Risks Identified in Recognition Phase
Common challenges in face recognition include:
Similar-looking students
Changes in facial expressions
Aging, beard, or hairstyle changes
These factors can reduce recognition accuracy if not handled properly.

8️⃣ Conclusion of Day 3
ArcFace provides highly discriminative and robust face embeddings, making it the most suitable model for accurate student identification in classroom attendance systems.
